<p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>
<p>cording to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>
<P> Director <B> Porter Goss </B> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:  </p><br>
   <Ul>
       <li>
         the Cold War
       </li>
       <li>

       </li>
       <li>
         the growth of the international drug trade
       </li>
